Taylor, the Water Poet, describes an execution he witnessed in Hamburg in 1616.  The judgment pronounced against a coiner of false money was that he should ‘<em>be boiled to death in oil</em>; not thrown into the vessel at once, but with a pulley or rope to be hanged under the armpits, and then let down into the oil <em>by degrees</em>; first the feet, and next the legs, and so to boil his flesh from his bones alive.’—Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue Laws, True and False, p. 13.</p><p>The Famous Stocking Case.</p><p>A woman and her daughter, <em>nine years old</em>, were hanged in Huntingdon for selling their souls to the devil, and raising a storm by pulling off their stockings!—Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue Laws, True and False, p. 20.</p><p>NOTE 10, Chapter XVII. Enslaving.</p></div> </div>
