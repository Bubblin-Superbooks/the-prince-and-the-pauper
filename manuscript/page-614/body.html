Enslaving.</p><p>So young a King and so ignorant a peasant were likely to make mistakes; and this is an instance in point.  This peasant was suffering from this law <em>by anticipation</em>; the King was venting his indignation against a law which was not yet in existence; for this hideous statute was to have birth in this little King’s <em>own reign</em>. However, we know, from the humanity of his character, that it could never have been suggested by him.</p></div> </div>
