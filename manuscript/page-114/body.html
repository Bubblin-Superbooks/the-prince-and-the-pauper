Will any be in all the land maintain there can be two, not of one blood and birth, so marvellously twinned?  And even were it so, ’twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should cast the one into the other’s place. Nay, ’tis folly, folly, folly!”</p><p>Presently he said—</p><p>“Now were he impostor and called himself prince, look you <em>that</em> would be natural; that would be reasonable.  But lived ever an impostor yet, who, being called prince by the king, prince by the court, prince by all, <em>denied</em> his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation?  <em>No</em>!
