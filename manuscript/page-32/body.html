Hark ye:  before the night come, she shall hie her to the Tower.  The King my father”—</p><p>“In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree.  The Tower is for the great alone.”</p><p>“True, indeed.  I had not thought of that.  I will consider of her punishment.  Is thy father kind to thee?”</p><p>“Not more than Gammer Canty, sir.”</p><p>“Fathers be alike, mayhap.  Mine hath not a doll’s temper.  He smiteth with a heavy hand, yet spareth me:  he spareth me not always with his tongue, though, sooth to say.  How doth thy mother use thee?”</p><p>“She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort. And Nan and Bet are like to her in this.”</p><p>“How old be these?”</p></div> </div>
