Her mother was more free and less particular; a troublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished with a wit above the common.”</p><p>“We lost her through it.  Her gift of palmistry and other sorts of fortune-telling begot for her at last a witch’s name and fame. The law roasted her to death at a slow fire.  It did touch me to a sort of tenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot—cursing and reviling all the crowd that gaped and gazed around her, whilst the flames licked upward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about her old gray head—cursing them! why an’ thou should’st live a thousand years thoud’st never hear so masterful a cursing.  Alack, her art died with her.  There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true blasphemy.”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Ruffler sighed; the listeners sighed in sympathy;</p></div> </div>
