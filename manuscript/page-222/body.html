<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>“Exert thy power—I would see a storm!”</p><p>There was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage, and a general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of the place—all of which was lost upon Tom, who was dead to everything but the proposed cataclysm.  Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman’s face, he added, excitedly—</p><p>“Never fear—thou shalt be blameless.  More—thou shalt go free—none shall touch thee.  Exert thy power.”</p><p>“Oh, my lord the King, I have it not—I have been falsely accused.”</p><p>“Thy fears stay thee.  Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer no harm.  Make a storm—it mattereth not how small a one—I require nought great or harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite—do this and thy life is spared—thou shalt go out free, with thy child, bearing the King’s pardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm.”</p></div> </div>
