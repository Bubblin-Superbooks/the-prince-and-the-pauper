<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>NOTES to Chapter XXIII. Death for Trifling Larcenies.</p><p>When Connecticut and New Haven were framing their first codes, larceny above the value of twelve pence was a capital crime in England—as it had been since the time of Henry I.—Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue Laws, True and False, p. 17.</p><p>The curious old book called The English Rogue makes the limit thirteen pence ha’penny:  death being the portion of any who steal a thing ‘above the value of thirteen pence ha’penny.’</p><p>NOTES to Chapter XXVII.</p><p>From many descriptions of larceny the law expressly took away the benefit of clergy:  to steal a horse, or a <em>hawk</em>, or woollen cloth from the weaver, was a hanging matter.  So it was to kill a deer from the King’s forest, or to export sheep from the kingdom.—Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue Laws, True and False, p.13.</p></div> </div>
